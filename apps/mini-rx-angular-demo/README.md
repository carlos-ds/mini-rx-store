MiniRx provides simple yet powerful state management with **[Feature Stores](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/fs-quick-start)**.
To manage state at large scale you can use the classic **[Redux API](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/redux)**.

This demo uses both the Redux API and the Feature Store API:

-   Todos Simple: Feature Store API
-   Todos: Feature Store API
-   Products and Cart: Redux API
-   User: Feature Store API
